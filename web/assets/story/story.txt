-Part 1-

Hey kid! Yeah, you!
Could you lend me a beer?
I forgot my money at home.

-Part 2-
   
Ooh! Still some hope for mankind! Cheers!
What about I give you a short story in return?

-Part 3-

-case "yes"-
Great, you are a generous one and a listener!
Your lover is lucky to have you.

-case "no"-
Anyway. Thanks for the beer!

So let me tell you a story about this drink here, a simple plain beer.
Aah! You know, this was brewed by history.

It was playing a part in every story about kings and swords, civilizations and endless riches.
Oh! Before I go further, you seem like a nice lad. What�s your name?
Let us share an interactive story.

-Part 4-

this.playerName + , ehj? That�s a fine name.
I wish I was called like that. It reminds me + this.randomFact + . Gips.

Is that a name for a boy or a girl? Sorry but my manners getting rustier every day.

-Part 5-
    
I'm Maurits. What�s in the past, is in the past but I was instead of a renowned drinker,
a very popular writer. My stories were heard everywhere and many sons were named to me.
Like everything fame has also a prize. I could have all the women in the world but the one person
who was true and destined to be by my side in the end�
I lost in my hometown with a family of my own during a fire. Ever since you can find me in places like this.

Anyhow! Back to the story! Could you give me the name of the place you dream of to be?

-Part 6-

Well, 500 years ago, there once was an abbey on the foot of the hill in a forgotten place called + this.placeName + .
It was forgotten because it wasn�t important or beautiful,
the people living there didn�t care about what happened around them.

-Part 7-

They had a job to attend to, shared a nice meal every evening with their families and that was enough for them.
Who their king was, didn't matter, they followed their instincts.
What language they had to speak, didn't matter, they understood each other.

this.fatherName + was a brewer town and was famous for his beer.
Sadly, his beer didn�t make him immortal and he died just when + this.playerName
his latest ancestor, was born.
People forgot the once so dearly known brewer and forgot the taste of his legacy.

-Part 8-

Years go by, little + this.playerName + grows older and finds one day the journals of + this.grammar.hisOrHer() + father.
It told + this.grammar.himOrHer() + about the fame and glory of his brewing and even gave a little hint
that he hid his recipe from the world when he knew his day came.

After + this.playerName + discovered this, + this.grammar.heOrShe() + was intrigued by it and asked Mother about it.
She confirmed everything about everything that was asked to her but she didn�t have a clue about were the secret recipe could be.
She only knew that her husband spent a lot of time in the silent abbey in the mountains
just before he passed away. He had to cleanse his soul and secure his future.

-Part 9-

Maybe his recipe is not far from this abbey?�, + this.playerName + questioned + this.grammar.himOrHer() + self.
The next morning + this.grammar.heOrShe() + packed + this.grammar.hisOrHer() + packs and left home determined to find the abbey.'
Days were like minutes. The further + this.playerName + came in the mountains, the faster + this.grammar.himOrHer() + heart beat.
Until one day + this.grammar.heOrShe() + found the old abbey. The first looks were covered with moss, cracks and holes but + this.playerName + knocked on the big entrance gate.

The wooden gate creaks open and an old, timid man shows himself after the wood. + this.playerName + tells the reason of + this.grammar.hisOrHer() + visit and asks if they still know + this.grammar.hisOrHer() + dad.
The man immediately invited + this.playerName + for a cup of tea and + this.playerName + enters.
this.abbotName + , the man who opened the gate, seemed to be the abbot of the abbey.
He told he was glad that someone still knew about the abbey. After some time, + this.playerName + heard what + this.grammar.heOrShe() + wanted to hear, the story of + this.grammar.hisOrHer() + father.
   
-Part 10-

this.abbotName + and + this.fatherName + had some common interests. + this.abbotName + was a well-known botanist + in his time of glory and had installed a little stall on the market of + this.placeName + , selling potions and other trinkets. 
this.fatherName + sought him out and talked about some way of brewing beer. He wanted to make another type of brew. Not the cheap ale anyone knew. A beer worth fighting for, a beer that wields power to make a difference in the world.

this.abbotName + , who was then just a broad-minded, young monk in the abbey, and + this.fatherName + had put their heads together to find this recipe. + They had built a nice garden in the abbey and acquired some brewery equipment. Every day they met to study together and to try things out.
It took months of time and hundreds of failed batches to get something. Until one day, the smell of their brewing opened up the cloudy sky. The sun shined upon the claystone of the courtyard. It was so magically that the people of + this.placeName +  came to visit the abbey to know what smelled so good.

-Part 11-

this.fatherName + and + this.abbotName + saw both what happened, they found the one true way of brewing. They were euphoric and terrified of their discovery.

One day, a man approached them. It was a man who sold himself as a servant of the king. His ears had heard of this beer and he demanded that the young monk and" + this.fatherName + only brew it for him, so he could overrule his opponents in his own way.
They both refused any cooperation because they knew the possible outcome. It was the idea of + this.fatherName + to hide the recipe in the mountains surrounding the abbey. No one could ever get to know this brew. In any century, in any world, this could be dangerous. It would forever be the secret of the mountains.
this.abbotName + ended his story to + this.playerName + that he never saw + this.grammar.hisOrHer() + father again after they got rid of the recipe. + this.playerName + asked if the old brewery in the abbey was still there. The abbot was delighted by this question and showed his precious place.
